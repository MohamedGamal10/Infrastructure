# Project Task: Building Infrastructure with Terraform and Configuring Docker with Ansible
## Objective:
Build and manage infrastructure across two availability zones (AZs) using Terraform, and configure Docker on private machines using Ansible. The project should leverage GitOps practices with your preferred CI/CD tool.

## Tools Required:
 - Terraform: For building the infrastructure.
 - Ansible: For configuration management and automation.
 - Docker: To be installed on private machines and used for running a container.
 - GitOps: For managing configurations and CI/CD processes.
 - CI/CD Tools: Choose one (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab Pipelines).


## Terraform Infrastructure Setup:
 - Create VPC and configure network needs.
 - For each AZ, create two subnets: one public and one private.
 - Set up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with two instances.
 - Place the Load Balancer (LB) in the public subnets.
 - Deploy the instances in the private subnets.
 - Ensure the private IPs of the instances are passed to an inventory file for later use.


## Bastion Host Configuration:
 - Set up a Bastion Host in the public subnet to manage access to the private instances.
 - After creating the infrastructure, copy the necessary Ansible role and configuration files to the Bastion Host.

## Ansible Configuration:
 - Use Ansible to install Docker on the private instances.
 - Create a custom Ansible role for Docker installation.
 - Run a nginx container on each private instance using Docker.

## GitOps Implementation:
 - Manage the entire configuration (Terraform and Ansible) using a Git repository.
 - Implement CI/CD pipelines using your chosen tool (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab Pipelines) to automate the deployment and configuration process.

## Hints:
 - You will execute the Ansible playbook on the Bastion Host.
 - Ensure that all configurations and scripts are stored and managed in a Git repository.
 - Use the inventory file created by Terraform to manage the target hosts for Ansible.
